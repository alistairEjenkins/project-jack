# project-jack


Hello Jack!

I have written a basic blackjack program in python for you to have a look at.
Can you read and understand the code? 
Shall we work on develop the project together:
make it multi-player?
add split options?
add a GUI?
add betting?

Don't know if you know how to play BlackJack? Ask dad!
love
Al xx
